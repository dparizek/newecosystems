StrikeBatches to prune an LBT from N nodes to S nodes:
 
Calculate least branching tree (LBT) --- see below.
Order LBT's edges by length (LONGEST first)
Strike SHORTER half of the edges. [If LBT has an odd number of edges, x, strike the shortest (x - 1)/2]
Recalculate LBT of the remaining (LONGER) half
Re-order (LONGEST first)
Strike SHORTER half of these.
Repeat the loop until LBT contains fewer than 2S edges (where S is the number desired in the set).
Use S-1 LONGEST edges remaining.
Return the list of nodes attached to these edges.

Kruskal method for calculating LeastBranchingTree:
 
Calculate the lengths of all edges.
Order from smallest to largest.
Choose first 2 edges.
Examine edge 3 and add it iff one or both of its nodes is not part of either of the first 2 edges.
Examine edge 4 and add it iff one or both of its nodes is not part of any of the previously added edges.
Examine edge 5 and add it iff one or both of its nodes is not part of any of the previously added edges.

Stop when the tree contains N-1 edges. This constitutes the LBT.
